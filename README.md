# isolated-scope-embeddable

## Purpose

`ng-transclude` does not have access to its template directive's isolated scope. I encountered [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7874) when attempting to use `ng-transclude` within an `ng-repeat`.

`isolated-scope-embeddable` (directive: `embeddable`) allows the replaced content to access the scope of its parent template directive.
